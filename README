= Extract Archive

Archive page types often contain the most child page which can get messy in Radiant's tree based navigation. Extract Archive pulls the children into their own padinated tab.

Once set the Archive's children will no longer display in the Radiant tree navigation. The children of an Archive can no longer create their own children.

It's a monkey patch so use at your own risk.


== To Do

- Fix cancel js, this observe is picking up the popup close event
- Add search filter ?
- Look into why will_paginate isn't creating the correct urls, currently using a js hack to fix this
