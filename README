= Extract

Extract a pages children into it's own paginated tab. Words best for pages like News that can get many children and require a paginated insterface in the admin.

Once set the children will no longer display in the default Radiant Admin but within it's own paginated tab.

It's a monkey patch so use at your own risk.


= To Do

- Write specs.
- Enable roles so only Admin / Desing can create Extract Pages types. (allowed_children)
- Redirect on Save / Cancel to the correct page.
- Add search filter ?
